# jQuery Code Challenge

In this challenge you will be creating an application that will create colored `<div>` tag each time the corresponding color is clicked. As each color (button) is clicked, it should increment the corresponding label. HTML and CSS are provided, the focus here is jQuery.

## Starting this project
To start this code challenge fork this repository and clone it to your machine.

**IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS**

* _HTML and CSS are provided_ and shouldn't require code changes.
* You can use jQuery's `.data()` method to retrieve the `data-color` HTML attributes. [A relevant StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5309926/how-to-get-the-data-id-attribute).
